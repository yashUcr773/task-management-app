# Calendar Page Auto-Redirect to Tasks Fix

## Issue Description
The calendar page (`/calendar`) was automatically redirecting to the tasks page (`/tasks`) within 1 second of loading, making it impossible to use the calendar view properly.

## Root Cause Analysis
After extensive investigation of the codebase, the issue was identified in the `TaskFilters` component (`src/components/tasks/task-filters.tsx`). This component was:

1. **Being used in both** `/tasks` and `/calendar` pages
2. **Hardcoded to redirect to `/tasks`** when any filter changed
3. **Automatically initializing filters** from URL parameters on mount
4. **Triggering navigation** through `router.push('/tasks')` regardless of the current page

### The Problematic Code
```tsx
// In TaskFilters component - line 137
const newUrl = queryString ? `/tasks?${queryString}` : '/tasks'

// This caused automatic redirect to /tasks from /calendar
if (window.location.pathname + window.location.search !== newUrl) {
  router.push(newUrl, { scroll: false })
}
```

### Why It Caused Immediate Redirect
1. Calendar page loads (`/calendar`)
2. `TaskFilters` component mounts and initializes
3. Component reads URL parameters (even if none exist)
4. Component constructs new URL with `/tasks` hardcoded
5. Component detects URL difference and calls `router.push('/tasks')`
6. User gets redirected to tasks page within ~1 second

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Made TaskFilters Component Flexible
Updated the `TaskFilters` component to accept a `basePath` prop:

```tsx
// Updated interface
interface TaskFiltersProps {
  onFiltersChange: (filters: FilterState) => void
  hasActiveFilters: boolean
  onClearFilters: () => void
  basePath?: string // New prop to customize base path
}

// Updated component function
export function TaskFilters({ 
  onFiltersChange, 
  hasActiveFilters, 
  onClearFilters, 
  basePath = '/tasks'  // Default to /tasks for backward compatibility
}: TaskFiltersProps) {
  // ... rest of component
}
```

### 2. Fixed URL Construction Logic
Updated the URL building logic to use the dynamic `basePath`:

```tsx
// Before (hardcoded)
const newUrl = queryString ? `/tasks?${queryString}` : '/tasks'

// After (dynamic)
const newUrl = queryString ? `${basePath}?${queryString}` : basePath
```

### 3. Updated Calendar View Usage
Modified the calendar view to pass the correct `basePath`:

```tsx
// In calendar-view.tsx
<TaskFilters
  onFiltersChange={handleFiltersChange}
  hasActiveFilters={hasActiveFilters}
  onClearFilters={clearFilters}
  basePath="/calendar"  // This prevents redirect to /tasks
/>
```

### 4. Preserved Tasks View Functionality
The tasks view continues to work as before since it doesn't pass a `basePath` prop, using the default `/tasks`:

```tsx
// In tasks-view.tsx (unchanged)
<TaskFilters
  onFiltersChange={handleFiltersChange}
  hasActiveFilters={hasActiveFilters}
  onClearFilters={clearFilters}
/>
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/components/tasks/task-filters.tsx`
- Added `basePath?: string` prop to interface
- Updated function signature with default value
- Modified URL construction logic to use dynamic basePath

### 2. `src/components/calendar/calendar-view.tsx`
- Added `basePath="/calendar"` prop to TaskFilters usage

## Testing & Validation

### Before Fix
- ❌ Navigate to `/calendar` → automatically redirected to `/tasks`
- ❌ Calendar page unusable
- ❌ Filter changes in calendar redirected to tasks

### After Fix
- ✅ Navigate to `/calendar` → stays on calendar page
- ✅ Calendar filters work within calendar context
- ✅ Tasks page continues to work normally
- ✅ URL parameters properly managed for each page
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Next.js build successful

## Impact Analysis

### Positive Impacts
1. **Calendar Functionality Restored**: Users can now access and use the calendar view
2. **Proper URL Management**: Each page manages its own URL parameters correctly
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Tasks page continues to work exactly as before
4. **Consistent Filter Behavior**: Filters work appropriately within their respective contexts

### No Breaking Changes
- Tasks view behavior unchanged (still uses `/tasks` as basePath)
- All existing filter functionality preserved
- No changes to component interfaces used by tasks view
- Real-time updates continue to work in both views

## Related Issues
This fix resolves the calendar redirect issue that was separate from the previously fixed task click redirect issue. The previous fix addressed task clicks within the calendar opening modals instead of navigating away, while this fix addresses the fundamental page-level redirect issue.

## Future Considerations
The `TaskFilters` component is now properly decoupled from page-specific routing logic, making it more reusable for potential future pages that might need filtering capabilities.

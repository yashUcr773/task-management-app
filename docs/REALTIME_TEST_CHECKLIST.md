## üìù Testing Instructions

### 1. Open Application
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/tasks`

### 2. Monitor WebSocket Connection
- Check browser console for connection messages
- Verify "Live" badge appears in TasksView header
- Confirm toast notification for successful connection

### 3. Test Real-Time Updates
- Watch for automatic task updates every 10 seconds
- Verify updates appear simultaneously across all view tabs
- Check that statistics and counters update correctly

### 4. Test Component Switching
- Switch between Table, List, Calendar, and Kanban views
- Verify all views receive real-time updates
- Confirm loading states display correctly on initial load

### 5. Test Error Scenarios
- Disconnect from network temporarily
- Verify reconnection and data sync
- Test recovery from server restart

## üêõ Known Issues to Verify

### Resolved Issues
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation errors in component props
- ‚úÖ Missing real-time props interface standardization

## 🚧 Features Currently Showing Placeholders (Need Implementation)

### 1. **File Attachments System** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY
**Current State**: Shows "0" attachments in task cards
**Database Ready**: No attachment tables in schema
**Implementation Needed**:
- Database schema for file attachments
- File upload API endpoints
- File storage system (local/cloud)
- Attachment display in task cards
- Download/preview functionality
- Real-time attachment updates

### 2. **Advanced Task Dependencies** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY  
**Current State**: Database schema exists but no UI
**Implementation Needed**:
- Task dependency creation interface
- Dependency visualization (Gantt charts)
- Blocking task indicators
- Dependency validation logic
- Real-time dependency updates

### 3. **Recurring Tasks** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Current State**: Database flag exists (`isRecurring`) but no system
**Implementation Needed**:
- Recurring task templates
- Schedule configuration (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Automatic task generation
- Recurring task management interface
- Real-time recurring task creation

### 4. **Enhanced Analytics & Reporting** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Current State**: Basic task statistics only
**Implementation Needed**:
- Time tracking integration
- Burndown charts and velocity metrics
- Team performance dashboards
- Report generation and export
- Real-time analytics updates

### 5. **Advanced Collaboration Features** 🟢 LOW PRIORITY
**Current State**: Basic comments implemented
**Implementation Needed**:
- @mentions in comments with notifications
- Real-time collaborative editing
- Task activity timeline
- Advanced notification system
- Presence indicators

---

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Test Real-Time Infrastructure (URGENT)
1. **Access Application**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/tasks`
2. **Verify Connection**: Check "Live" status indicator
3. **Test Updates**: Watch automatic task changes every 10 seconds
4. **Validate Views**: Test all component views receive updates
5. **Document Results**: Record any issues or performance observations

### Phase 2: File Attachments Implementation (HIGH PRIORITY)
The most visible missing feature affecting user experience.

**Database Schema Addition**:
```prisma
model Attachment {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  filename    String
  originalName String
  mimeType    String
  size        Int
  url         String
  taskId      String
  uploadedBy  String
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  
  task Task @relation(fields: [taskId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  user User @relation(fields: [uploadedBy], references: [id])
  
  @@map("attachments")
}

// Add to Task model
model Task {
  // ... existing fields
  attachments Attachment[]
}

// Add to User model  
model User {
  // ... existing fields
  attachments Attachment[]
}
```

**API Endpoints Needed**:
- `POST /api/tasks/{id}/attachments` - Upload file
- `GET /api/tasks/{id}/attachments` - List attachments  
- `DELETE /api/attachments/{id}` - Remove attachment
- `GET /api/attachments/{id}/download` - Download file

**UI Components Needed**:
- File upload component in task details
- Attachment list with download links
- Drag-and-drop file upload area
- File type icons and previews
- Real-time attachment count updates

### Phase 3: Task Dependencies (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Database ready, need UI implementation.

**UI Components Needed**:
- Dependency selection interface
- Visual dependency indicators
- Gantt chart or dependency graph
- Blocking task warnings

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (LOWER PRIORITY)
- Recurring tasks system
- Enhanced analytics
- Advanced collaboration features

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Approach

### For File Attachments (Next Focus)
1. **Storage Strategy**: 
   - Local: `public/uploads/` directory
   - Cloud: AWS S3 or similar (production)
   - Database: Store metadata only, not files

2. **Security Considerations**:
   - File type validation
   - Size limits
   - Virus scanning (production)
   - Access control per organization

3. **Real-Time Integration**:
   - WebSocket events for attachment changes
   - Update task cards with new counts
   - Live notifications for team members

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Image thumbnails for previews
   - Lazy loading for attachment lists
   - Compressed file storage

## 🎯 Success Criteria for Next Phase

### Real-Time Testing Success:
- [ ] WebSocket connection establishes successfully
- [ ] All view components receive live updates
- [ ] No performance degradation during updates
- [ ] Error handling works correctly
- [ ] Connection recovery after network issues

### File Attachments Success:
- [ ] Users can upload files to tasks
- [ ] Attachment counts show correctly in task cards
- [ ] Files can be downloaded and previewed
- [ ] Real-time updates work for attachments
- [ ] Security and size limits enforced

---

**Current Recommendation**: Focus on testing the real-time infrastructure first, then immediately implement the file attachments system as it's the most visible missing feature affecting user experience.

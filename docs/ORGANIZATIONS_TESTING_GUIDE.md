   - Change member roles (admin only)
   - Remove members (admin only)
   - Prevent removing last admin

3. **Join Organizations**
   - Join via invite codes
   - Support for full invite URLs or just codes
   - Input validation and error handling

4. **UI/UX Features**
   - Modern card-based layout
   - Role indicators and badges
   - Member avatars and details
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
   - Toast notifications for feedback
   - Loading states throughout

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Start the Development Server

```bash
cd c:\Github\yashUcr773\task-management-app
npm run dev
```

### 2. Navigate to Organizations

1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Sign in to your account
3. Click "Organizations" in the sidebar navigation

### 3. Test Create Organization

1. Click "Create Organization" button
2. Fill in organization name and description
3. Click "Create Organization"
4. Verify organization appears in the list

### 4. Test Organization Management

1. Click "Manage" on an organization you're admin of
2. Test member search functionality
3. Try changing member roles (if you have other members)
4. Test member removal (ensure last admin can't be removed)

### 5. Test Edit Organization

1. Click "Edit" on an organization you're admin of
2. Update name or description
3. Save changes and verify updates appear

### 6. Test Join Organization

1. Click "Join Organization" button
2. Try entering an invite code (you'll need a valid one)
3. Test both direct codes and full URLs

### 7. Test Leave Organization

1. Click "Leave" on an organization you're not the last admin of
2. Confirm the action
3. Verify organization is removed from your list

## Expected Database Schema

Make sure your database has these models from the Prisma schema:

```prisma
model Organization {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  name        String
  description String?
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
  users       UserOrganization[]
  teams       Team[]
}

model UserOrganization {
  id             String       @id @default(cuid())
  userId         String
  organizationId String
  role           Role         @default(USER)
  joinedAt       DateTime     @default(now())
  user           User         @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  organization   Organization @relation(fields: [organizationId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  @@unique([userId, organizationId])
}

enum Role {
  ADMIN
  USER
  VIEWER
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Navigation not showing Organizations link**
   - Check that `app-navigation.tsx` includes the organizations link
   - Verify user is authenticated

2. **API errors**
   - Check that all API routes are properly created
   - Verify database schema matches expected structure
   - Check console for detailed error messages

3. **Permission errors**
   - Ensure user has appropriate role for admin actions
   - Check that organization membership exists

4. **TypeScript errors**
   - All files should compile without errors
   - Role enum should use ADMIN, USER, VIEWER (not MODERATOR)

5. **Organization creation errors**
   - ✅ **FIXED**: Description field validation now properly handles empty/null values
   - The API now accepts optional descriptions without throwing validation errors

### Next Steps

After testing the basic functionality, you can:

1. Add invite code generation for organizations
2. Implement organization-specific dashboards
3. Add organization settings and preferences
4. Integrate organizations with teams and tasks
5. Add organization analytics and reporting

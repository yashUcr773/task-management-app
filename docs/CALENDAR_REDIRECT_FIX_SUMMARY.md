# Calendar Redirect Issue Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The calendar view had a critical navigation issue where clicking on any task would automatically redirect users to the tasks page (`/tasks?taskId=${task.id}`) instead of staying in the calendar view.

## Root Cause
In `src/components/calendar/calendar-view.tsx`, the `handleTaskClick` function was programmed to navigate away from the calendar:

```tsx
const handleTaskClick = (task: TasksWithUsersAndTags) => {
  // Navigate to tasks page with the specific task selected
  router.push(`/tasks?taskId=${task.id}`)
}
```

This caused users to lose their calendar context whenever they clicked on a task, making the calendar view less useful.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Added TaskDetailsModal Integration
- **Import Added**: Added `TaskDetailsModal` from `@/components/tasks/task-details-modal`
- **State Management**: Added state variables for modal control:
  ```tsx
  const [selectedTaskId, setSelectedTaskId] = useState<string | null>(null)
  const [taskDetailsOpen, setTaskDetailsOpen] = useState(false)
  ```

### 2. Updated Task Click Handler
- **Before**: Navigated away from calendar to tasks page
- **After**: Opens task details in a modal popup within the calendar view:
  ```tsx
  const handleTaskClick = (task: TasksWithUsersAndTags) => {
    // Open task details modal instead of navigating away
    setSelectedTaskId(task.id)
    setTaskDetailsOpen(true)
  }
  ```

### 3. Added Modal Component
- **Modal Integration**: Added `TaskDetailsModal` component at the end of the calendar view
- **Real-time Updates**: Integrated with existing real-time task system
- **Callback Handling**: Added proper update callbacks for real-time synchronization

```tsx
<TaskDetailsModal
  taskId={selectedTaskId}
  open={taskDetailsOpen}
  onOpenChange={setTaskDetailsOpen}
  onTaskUpdate={() => {
    // The real-time hook will automatically handle updates
    console.log("Task updated, real-time hook will handle refresh")
  }}
/>
```

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- **Primary**: `src/components/calendar/calendar-view.tsx`
  - Added import for `TaskDetailsModal`
  - Added state management for modal
  - Updated `handleTaskClick` function
  - Integrated modal component

### Dependencies Utilized
- **Existing Modal**: Leveraged the existing `TaskDetailsModal` component used in tasks view
- **State Management**: Used React hooks for modal state
- **Real-time Integration**: Connected to existing real-time task updates

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix
1. ❌ Click task in calendar → Redirected to tasks page
2. ❌ Lost calendar context and navigation
3. ❌ Had to navigate back to calendar manually
4. ❌ Poor user experience for calendar workflows

### After Fix
1. ✅ Click task in calendar → Opens detailed modal
2. ✅ Stays in calendar context
3. ✅ Can view/edit task details without losing position
4. ✅ Modal dismisses back to calendar view
5. ✅ Real-time updates maintain calendar synchronization

## Benefits

### 1. **Improved Navigation Flow**
- Users remain in calendar context
- No unexpected page redirections
- Seamless task viewing experience

### 2. **Consistent UX Pattern**
- Matches the pattern used in tasks view
- Familiar modal-based task interaction
- Consistent with application design

### 3. **Real-time Integration**
- Task updates reflect immediately in calendar
- WebSocket integration maintains live data
- No need for manual refresh after task edits

### 4. **Enhanced Productivity**
- Quick task viewing without context switching
- Faster task management workflows
- Better calendar-centric task management

## Testing Validation

### Build Verification
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Next.js build completed successfully
- ✅ All routes generated properly

### Expected Behavior
1. **Calendar Load**: Calendar displays with filters and real-time updates
2. **Task Click**: Clicking any task opens modal instead of navigating
3. **Modal Interaction**: Task details, comments, and attachments accessible
4. **Modal Close**: Dismissing modal returns to calendar view
5. **Real-time Updates**: Changes reflect immediately without refresh

## Future Considerations

### 1. **Edit Integration**
The modal currently shows task details. Future enhancement could add direct editing capabilities within the calendar modal for even smoother workflows.

### 2. **Quick Actions**
Could add quick action buttons (status change, priority update) directly in the calendar task view for faster updates.

### 3. **Calendar Navigation**
Consider adding calendar-specific navigation controls in the modal for browsing between tasks by date.

## Conclusion

This fix resolves the major navigation issue in the calendar view, providing users with a much better experience when viewing task details. The implementation leverages existing components and patterns, ensuring consistency and maintainability while significantly improving the calendar workflow.

The calendar now functions as a proper standalone view where users can manage their tasks without losing context, making it a valuable tool for calendar-based task management workflows.
